# Pathfinder-AStar

Demo of a simple implementation of the A* pathfinder algorithm

You need to download unity3D to build or play this project

I will make a little demo video

Controls:

-Nothing usefull, but I wanted to try to interpolate between 2 diffrent camera perspective, with diffrent interpolation algorithm

- Q: linear interpolation
- W: SmoothStep
- E: SmootherStep
- R: SmoothestStep
